1. We don't use Cadence enum, because:

Enum support was only recently added to the SDK and FCL.
- SDK: 0.0.54 https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/master/packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md#0054----2021-07-23
- FCL: 0.0.77-alpha.1 https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk/blob/master/packages/fcl/CHANGELOG.md#0077-alpha1---2021-07-23

FLOW-JS_TESTING doesn't support enum at all.
In our project we use JS.

2. NFT will be burn and the last bid will be released in 3 cases:
    Auction is cancelled. In this case we display message about cancel auction on our site.
    Nobody bids until the end of auction (No release bid in this case). Clients have no interest to our NFTs. Nobody cares.
    In case of call destroy function. This behaivor is under our control, because contrcts will be deployed to our account.

3. ReclaimSendNFT is added for case to handle sending NFT to winner. In failuer case, after winner connects to our suupot, 
    we can change recipient capability in this case.

4. In case of failure to return the bid to outbidded person, this bid will sent to platform vault and after we can handle this situation by support.
Some events are added for this case.
But this case extremely rarely, because FUSD should be destroyed on the account.

5. If I attempt to outbid *myself*, will I lose my previous bid here?
   No. Your bid will be accumulated. If you bid 10 and after 5, your bid will be 15. If somebody outbid you, all amount of FUSD will be returned.
